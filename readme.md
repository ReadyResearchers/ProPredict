# Linear Regression Analysis of Basketballs Top Offensive Strategies

**Background** This sports analytics web app uses `Streamlits` user interactive dashboard, to be able to conduct research and analysis on sports data. Specifically my project is analyzing how offensive strategies have changed overtime in the NBA dating from the late 1990's up till the end of the 2021 season. Streamlit's graphing tools that allow a user to pick and choose elements from their dataset to be able to visualize possible correlations between statistics and analyze change overtime in their data.


# Installation(s)**

- Install streamlit using pip

```text
command: pip install streamlit
```

- Run the file to transform code into a web app!

```text
command: streamlit run <name_of_python_file>
```


# How to use

Once you are on your streamlit web app it will take you to the home page of the site.


- Select your downloaded `csv` file

- Choose your X and Y elements for your graphs

- Analyze the output of the linear regression table/graph

- Investigate and Explore all the data points you want!
